    "## The Hidden Garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a small town, there was a garden hidden behind a tall wall. The townsfolk often whispered about it, saying it was enchanted. No one had seen the inside, but everyone had their own stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some said it was filled with flowers that could sing, while others believed it was home to a wise old owl that could grant wishes. \n",
    "\n",
    "One sunny afternoon, a curious girl named Lily decided to explore the garden. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lilly had always been fascinated by the stories and wanted to see if they were true. \n",
    "\n",
    "As she approached the wall, she noticed a small, rusty gate slightly ajar. \n",
    "\n",
    "With her heart racing, she pushed it open and stepped inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The garden was more beautiful than she had imagined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Colorful flowers bloomed everywhere, and the air was filled with sweet scents. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the center stood an ancient oak tree, its branches stretching wide, offering shade to a small stone bench. \n",
    "\n",
    "As she walked closer, she noticed a figure sitting on the bench—a boy about her age, with messy brown hair and bright green eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hi, I’m Jack,” he said, smiling. “I come here to think.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hi, I’m Lily,” she replied, feeling a strange connection with him. “I’ve heard so many stories about this place.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack nodded. “Most of them are true. The flowers do sing, but only when they feel happy. And the owl? He’s real too. He watches over the garden.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lily’s eyes widened. “Can we see him?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack hesitated. “He only appears when he senses someone who truly believes in magic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lily felt a spark of determination. “I believe! Let’s find him!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they explored the garden, laughing and sharing stories. They discovered a patch of flowers that began to hum softly when they danced around them. The more they danced, the louder the flowers sang, filling the air with joy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As they played, they talked about their lives. Lily shared how she often felt lonely at school, while Jack revealed that he had a sick sister who couldn’t leave their home. They both understood what it felt like to wish for something more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, the air grew still, and a soft hoot echoed through the garden. They turned to see a majestic owl perched on a low branch of the oak tree. Its feathers shimmered in the sunlight, and its eyes sparkled with wisdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Welcome, young ones,” the owl said in a deep, soothing voice. “You have shown kindness and belief. What is it that you seek?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lily and Jack exchanged glances, unsure of what to say. Finally, Lily spoke up. “I wish for Jack’s sister to get better.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The owl nodded slowly. “True friendship and selflessness are the greatest forms of magic. I will grant your wish, but remember, kindness must be shared.”\n",
    "\n",
    "With a flap of its wings, the owl vanished into the air, leaving behind a soft glow. Jack looked at Lily, tears of gratitude in his eyes. “Thank you, Lily. You’ve given me hope.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As the sun began to set, they promised to meet again in the garden. They had found not only magic but also a friendship that would last a lifetime.\n",
